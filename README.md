# ShapeExplorer

This GUI app was developed to visualize both 2D and 3D shapes and perform calculations like area, perimeter, and volume. I used inheritance and interfaces to model shape properties and built a JavaFX interface to let users explore geometry dynamically. It deepened my knowledge of polymorphism and helped me create a cleaner UI/UX workflow.
